# mcp-stock_market
This project uses advanced LLMs and financial tools to predict stock prices and automate trading. It integrates sentiment analysis, market trends, fraud detection, and real-time action insights to generate smart buy/sell signals, with future support for brokerage API trading.
# üìä AI-Driven Stock Prediction & Automated Trading System

This project aims to build an advanced stock prediction and trading automation platform powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and enriched with access to diverse financial tools and data assets.

By leveraging cutting-edge AI techniques, this system analyzes **market sentiment**, **trends**, **potential fraud signals**, and **real-time trading actions** to generate intelligent buy/sell decisions. In future development phases, it will integrate with brokerage APIs to execute trades automatically.
